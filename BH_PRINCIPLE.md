# Hierarchical Bits — The Principle

> *From a file format to a representation model.*

The applicability sweep ([`applicability/`](applicability/)) established something
uncomfortable and clarifying: the BH **shape** — a heavy substrate stored once,
many co-registered layers, selective reads — is **already mature SOTA** in nearly
every domain where it matters (DICOM, COG/STAC, lakeFS, CRAM/tabix, MAM, S-LoRA,
named graphs). Selling BH as "substrate + overlays" is selling something the
world already has.

So the contribution is not the format. It is a **principle** the prototypes are
instances of — and principles survive where formats age.

## The thesis

> **Hierarchical Bits is not a storage format. It is a representation model in
> which multiple concurrent — and possibly contradictory — interpretations share
> a single immutable substrate and persist as co-equal, first-class,
> individually addressable entities; adjudication between them is deferred to
> read-time and optional, never baked in and never destructive.**

## The distinguishing test

What separates a BH representation from an `ANCHOR` system (one that *also*
stores the substrate once and reads it selectively)?

> Given two interpretations that **disagree** about the same element of the
> substrate, can **both remain** — permanently, queryable, neither marked wrong —
> until a reader chooses, or declines, to adjudicate?

- **`ANCHOR` systems answer no.** They converge to one canonical truth: a
  consensus mask, a gold label, a final coding decision, a merged model, a
  resolved clash. Disagreement is a *problem to be resolved* — noise on the way
  to ground truth.
- **BH answers yes.** Disagreement is *data to be preserved*. The rival readings
  coexist as permanent residents; the system never forces one to win by erasing
  another.

That single yes/no is the whole difference.

## The four properties

| # | property | shared with ANCHOR? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Immutable shared substrate** — stored once, referenced by all layers | yes — already SOTA |
| 2 | **Interpretations as first-class entities** — persistent and addressable, not on-the-fly derived views nor mergeable annotations | partly |
| 3 | **Coexistence of contradiction** — rival readings of the *same* element are preserved together, as data | **no — the differentiator** |
| 4 | **Deferred, optional adjudication** — at read time the reader picks a lens: one interpretation / the matrix / the majority / the disagreement | **no — the differentiator** |

Property 1 is the part that is already everywhere. Properties **3 and 4** are
the part the sweep found **still under-explored**: most systems treat rival
interpretations as a mess to clean up, not as co-equal entities to keep.

## The prototypes are instances, not the point

Each `.bh` prototype is one instance of the principle — and they vary in how
sharply they exercise properties 3–4:

| instance | substrate | rival interpretations | adjudication deferred? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`bhanno`](bhanno/) | a media item | K annotators that disagree | **yes** — `adjudicate()` is optional; the purest instance |
| [`bhmem`](bhmem/) | the interaction log | conflicting belief/fact versions over time | partial — rival temporal versions kept |
| [`bhckpt`](bhckpt/) | base model weights | adapters / quantizations (alternative, mostly *additive*) | weak — interpretations rarely contradict |
| [`bhtrace`](bhtrace/) | the span tree | competing analysis lenses / root-cause hypotheses | weak — lenses coexist more than contradict |
| `bhbim` (candidate) | the building object-graph | rival discipline/version overlays + clashes | **yes** — the one BUILD domain in the sweep |

The closer an instance sits to "rival readings preserved without forced
adjudication," the more it expresses what is *new* about BH versus the ANCHOR
systems. `bhanno` (and the proposed `bhbim`) are the sharp instances; the others
demonstrate the *generalization* but lean on the already-SOTA substrate-sharing.

## Honest scope

- This is the differential **observed so far, in the 20 domains surveyed** — not
  a closed claim that properties 3–4 are BH's *only* possible value. New domains
  may surface other under-served slices.
- The substrate-sharing economics (property 1) remain real and measured in the
  prototypes — they are just **not novel**. BH's claim there is credibility by
  analogy, not invention.
- "Without forced adjudication" is a *representation* stance, not a truth claim:
  BH surfaces the contest and the majority; it does not decide who is right.
  Resolving truth stays a modeling choice the reader makes, or declines.

## Why this is the advance

It moves the centre of gravity from the **file** to the **model**. If the thesis
above can be stated precisely — and the distinguishing test makes it falsifiable:
*does this system preserve contradicting interpretations without adjudication, or
not?* — then the value of BH stops depending on any single prototype and starts
depending on the clarity and generality of the principle. The prototypes become
evidence; the principle becomes the contribution.
