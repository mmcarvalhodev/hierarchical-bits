# Hierarchical Bits (BH)

> **A structural envelope: it represents a heterogeneous asset, navigates parts
> of it without loading everything, and delegates each region to the best
> specialist format.**

📄 **Read online (bilingual site):** https://mmcarvalhodev.github.io/bits-hierarquicos/

Most formats force you to pick **one**: *compact* (JPEG/WebP — but to see one
piece, you decode all of it) **or** *navigable* (indexes, OLAP, vector DB — but
it's structure bolted on top, across several systems that must be kept in sync).
BH writes **one envelope** where structure is part of the format: compact **and**
navigable, in a single file.

```
1. makes structure EXPLICIT   — hierarchy, belonging (cost: 0–6%)
2. ROUTES each region          — photo→WebP, gradient→formula, text→PNG
3. allows MULTIPLE readings    — preview / region / aggregate / proof
```

## The core capability (not a benchmark)

The heart of BH is not "being smaller". It's **reading only the part you need,
without decoding the rest** — a property of the format, not of a dataset.

**`bhmem`** ([`bhmem/`](bhmem/)) is the first usable artifact: agent memory as
`.bh`. The agent reads the summary, a topic, a time window or the provenance
**without loading the whole memory** (measured in real bytes read):

| reading | bytes read | vs flat store (reads all) |
|---|---|---|
| `summary()` — digest of all topics | 2.5% | **36× less** |
| `recall(topic)` — one branch | 4.0% | **22× less** |
| `since(t)` — time window | 9.8% | **9× less** |
| `provenance(id)` — source of 1 memory | 10.8% | **8× less** |

## Where it pays off and where it delegates (the honest boundary)

```
WINS       STRUCTURE-dominant data: documents, diagrams, layered data,
           structured AI outputs, symbolic knowledge. At the limit (rule-
           generated data): the payload becomes the PROGRAM that generates it
           — 800–3,600×.
DELEGATES  dense signal (photo, audio, embedding) → WebP/AVIF/HNSW reign, and
           BH CALLS them. It doesn't compete where it shouldn't.
```

The boundary is not entropy — it's **structure recognition**.
