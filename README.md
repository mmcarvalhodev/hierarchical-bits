# Hierarchical Bits (BH)

> **Hierarchical Bits (BH) is a representation model where multiple — possibly
> contradictory — interpretations share one immutable substrate and stay
> queryable, without duplicating the data and without forcing them into a single
> truth.**

The heart, in one line: **don't duplicate the world every time someone disagrees
with it.** Start from a common base — one dataset, one building, one document set,
one history. Over it, several interpretations naturally arise: annotators label
it, disciplines read it differently, hypotheses compete over it, versions
accumulate. Today, holding them forces a bad choice — **copy the base** once per
interpretation, or **merge to one** and lose the rest.

## What makes it different — and what doesn't

Storing a substrate once and reading it selectively is **already mature SOTA** —
DICOM, COG/STAC, lakeFS, CRAM/tabix, S-LoRA, MAM. BH does **not** claim to invent
that. A [20-domain sweep](applicability/) pointed to the still-under-explored
property, which we give a **working name**: the **First-Class Interpretation
Representation (FCIR)** — interpretations kept as persistent, addressable,
co-equal entities over a shared substrate, with adjudication **deferred and
optional**.

> The honest claim, scoped to what we surveyed: **our investigation identified
> FCIR as the property that best distinguishes BH from the approaches evaluated**
> — a result, not a universal law, and a working name that should follow the idea
> rather than cage it. See [`BH_PRINCIPLE.md`](BH_PRINCIPLE.md).

**The distinguishing test (falsifiable):** given two interpretations that
disagree about the same element, can **both remain** — neither marked wrong —
until a reader chooses (or declines) to adjudicate? Many systems converge to one
truth, or isolate each reading into an independent copy/version. BH keeps them
co-registered over one substrate and lets adjudication wait.
